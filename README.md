# horizon-tools

Horizon is a personal time tracking project.
This repository is a set of tools to anaylise tracking logs.

## Method

I track my days with two systems:

- bullet journaling: I'm using a bunch of simple text files to follow bullet
  journaling practices. I find it more convenient to use a file than an actual
  pen and journal since it's easier to copy/paste and search for informations.
  I also feel more confortable in my text editor too.

- tracking logs: I create a text file per week. Each line represents an activity
  with the following syntax:

  ```
  YYYY-MM-DD  <dur>H  <tag>  <description>
  ```

  I only track activities that occupy more than 1H in my day time.

## Usage

wip

```
  $ ./horizon

```
